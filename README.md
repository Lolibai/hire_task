# Hire Task
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.
## Needed for start 

### `yarn`

Installs `node_modules` for running the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

## How to customize component

Simply look at the JS file `src/static/data/togglesData.js`. Make your custom object similar to what is in sample file. 

```
export const toggles = {
    data: [
        {
            id: 0,
            left: 'Hot',
            right: 'Cold',
            mustbe: false
        },
        {
            id: 1,
            left: 'Good pay',
            right: 'Bad pay',
            mustbe: true
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            left: 'Active',
            right: 'Not active',
            mustbe: false
        }
    ],
    question: "What are the ideal conditions inside an office?"
};
```
Done.
